            <p>My name is Zarin Hawthorne, I am from Illinois Chicago. I am an incoming game programmer who still has lots to learn. I am studying game programming and animation at Columbia College of Chicago. My hobbies are drawing, either digital or traditional. I really enjoy watching movies, shows, and any sort of animated projects. My hope is that you will enjoy my work and the things that I will make in the near future.</p>
