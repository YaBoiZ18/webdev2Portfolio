                <h3>Why do you support Ai art?</h3>
    
                <p>It took OP a day to respond to my email and they did make some alright points. He wrote a lot so I will summarize it. So basically, what OP was that they believe in its transformative potential to enhance and complement human creativity rather than supplant it. One of the points they make was that “AI art introduces novel techniques and approaches that expand the creative landscape. By leveraging algorithms and machine learning, AI can generate artworks that challenge traditional notions of creativity and inspire new forms of expression.” I can kind of see where they were coming from as they tried to explain the innovation and creativity that Ai art can bring. There were other points OP made such as the boundaries it could push, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and much more. Even though this was just text on a screen, but I can tell that they were passionate about this.</p>

            <section class="q2">
                <h3>Do you think it’s okay for Ai artists to be considered artistes?</h3>
    
                <p>This response surprisingly took like a minute to get back to me. And as I expected their answer was yes. When I pushed further, they made points about how the term "artist" traditionally refers to individuals who engage in creative expression, regardless of the tools or techniques they employ. That Ai artists demonstrate creativity, intentionality, and conceptual depth in their works, just like human artists. They also made a list of reasons why Ai artists deserve recognition as legitimate artists. Such as their creative intent, their expression and interpretation, and many more. Their conclusion was, “AI artists demonstrate the hallmarks of artistic practice, including creativity, intentionality, expression, and innovation. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate to consider them as artists, deserving of recognition and respect within the broader artistic community.”</p>

            <section class="q3">
                <h3>Do you think that human art is still wanted?</h3>
    
                <p>This response took longer than the other two as they didn’t get back to me until two days later. Their response kind of surprised me as their answer was yes. They went into how human art has a unique perspective and expression, how, “Human artists bring a depth of personal experience, emotion, and perspective to their creations that cannot be replicated by AI. Their unique insights and individuality result in artworks that resonate with audiences on a deeply human level.” They also went into detail about the emotional connection that human art has, the craftsmanship and skill, the individuality and authenticity, and lastly the collaboration and community. In summary, their reason was that while AI art offers exciting possibilities and innovations, human art remains essential and irreplaceable. Its ability to convey emotion, capture cultural and historical nuances, and celebrate individual creativity ensures that it will always be wanted and valued in our society.</p>
