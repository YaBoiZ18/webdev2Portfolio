            <h2>My Reason</h2>
            <p>“Is human art still wanted with the new rise of ai
                art?” This topic is important to me as I too am an artist, though my art skills are none of
                noteworthy proportions I still feel obliged to talk about this. With the rise of ai art a lot of
                artists, including myself, have a lot of varying opinions on it. For one lots of artists are
                worried about how they might be replaced by ai, I have seen some really good ai art
                from strolling on twitter or Instagram. And I can see why they would be worried, some of
                the art that I’ve seen could barely be told apart if it was made by ai or a human. The
                only way was if it was stated or the very little mistakes from the art. It has gotten to the
                point that ai can copy someone else's art style, which caused a lot of problems. I’m not
                worried about my art style being copied, as it’s not noteworthy, but I am worried about
                other artists’ styles being copied. I do understand how others feel when their things get
                taken and credited for someone else's work, which has happened to me before, so I
                know the feeling of it. Which leads me to want to pursue this, as a lot of audiences
                either likes ai art or doesn’t. There are also a lot of people who are in the middle, people
                who do like the ai art often defend it even when it copies other artist's styles. Often
                saying that it’s just an opportunity to see other art styles in a more unique way now, and
                that they won't have to wait now for them to draw. Which makes me think, what do
                people look for when they see art? Do they just like the thing they’re looking at, or do
                they like the passion that artist brings in the image? If so, do they care for human artists
                anymore?</p>
