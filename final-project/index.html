            <h2>My Reason</h2>
            <p>“Is human art still wanted with the new rise of ai
                art?” This topic is important to me as I too am an artist, though my art skills are none of
                noteworthy proportions I still feel obliged to talk about this. With the rise of ai art a lot of
                artists, including myself, have a lot of varying opinions on it. For one lots of artists are
                worried about how they might be replaced by ai, I have seen some really good ai art
                from strolling on twitter or Instagram. And I can see why they would be worried, some of
                the art that I’ve seen could barely be told apart if it was made by ai or a human. The
                only way was if it was stated or the very little mistakes from the art. It has gotten to the
                point that ai can copy someone else's art style, which caused a lot of problems. I’m not
                worried about my art style being copied, as it’s not noteworthy, but I am worried about
                other artists’ styles being copied. I do understand how others feel when their things get
                taken and credited for someone else's work, which has happened to me before, so I
                know the feeling of it. Which leads me to want to pursue this, as a lot of audiences
                either likes ai art or doesn’t. There are also a lot of people who are in the middle, people
                who do like the ai art often defend it even when it copies other artist's styles. Often
                saying that it’s just an opportunity to see other art styles in a more unique way now, and
                that they won't have to wait now for them to draw. Which makes me think, what do
                people look for when they see art? Do they just like the thing they’re looking at, or do
                they like the passion that artist brings in the image? If so, do they care for human artists
                anymore?</p>

            <h3>Interview #1: OP</h3>
            <p>So, this interview was weird and complicated to say the least. My original plan was to hopefully get an Ai artist, but they flaked out at the last minute. But instead, I got someone who supported Ai art instead. They did however only want to chat through emails and kept their identity hidden, so I will call them OP during this.</p>

            <p>Leon is a long-time friend of mine, we have known each other since kindergarten. He is a student studying illustration. He’s also the main reason why I draw today, as we always drew things together in the past. We chatted over discord. </p>

            <p>Antonio is another friend of mine I met in high school freshman year. He is an artist like me but doesn’t draw as much. But he does dislike Ai art from what I remember. We talked on the phone. </p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>My Conclusion</h2>
            <p>A complicated interaction between creativity, authenticity, and emotional connection is shown by comparing artificial intelligence (AI) generated art with human art. The creative world is divided on the subject of AI art, with views ranging from strong support to severe skepticism. This has created both enthusiasm and anxiety.

                AI art supporters, such as OP, highlight the technology's capacity to expand the creative possibilities and revolutionary potential. They contend that artificial intelligence (AI)-generated artworks present cutting-edge methods and strategies that broaden the field of creativity and should be respected and acknowledged as valid forms of artistic expression. But as Leon and Antonio have shown, questions remain about the soul and emotional depth that human creativity has. While acknowledging the amazing progress made in AI, Leon is skeptical of the technology's capacity to fully represent human experience and emotion. He contends that although strictly speaking, AI-generated art may be considered art, it lacks the purpose and sense of self that characterize human art. Antonio also raises concerns about authenticity, ownership, and the diminishing value of human creativity in light of AI's capacity to mimic human artistic forms.

                In the end, every interviewee agrees that human art is still unique and intrinsically meaningful. Audiences continue to be emotionally moved by the emotional connection and authenticity that human-created art possesses, even in spite of the creative potential that artificial intelligence art presents. AI is unable to duplicate the uniqueness, cultural history, and personal narratives that are reflected in human art. In conclusion, artificial intelligence (AI) art can be innovative and exploratory, but it will never be able to completely replace the distinct viewpoint, feeling, and genuineness that human artists bring to their creations. Because it can generate relationships that go beyond technical reproduction and communicate the depths of human experience, human art will always be treasured and sought after.</p>
