                <h3>My Reflection</h3>
    
                <p>So, as I was building my final project for this class, I learned something. For one, not everything is going to go to plan. As I had to change some things that I originally wanted to do. Like one of the things that I would have liked to do was when you scroll down the website the color of the text would change. But as I was making the website, I just didn’t see it happening anymore. When I ran into issues adding background photos to the website, that was another obstacle. I spent a lot of time trouble shooting and trying out various alternatives, but I was unable to get the intended result. Thankfully, my teacher gave me helpful guidance and recommended a different strategy, which allowed me to save a ton of time and work. Even though it was a setback, I learned how important it is to be adaptable and ask for help when I need it. There are also a few other things as well that changed the things that I originally wanted to do, so I decided to just go with something simple. It’s kind of a downgrade from what I wanted to do, but with the other things such as finals for my other classes I don’t really have the time and energy to do so. Like my C++ teacher yesterday (4/29/24) decided to not only give us a project to do, but also an exam and another project to do out of nowhere. Plus, I have a storyboard project that I need to finish as well... But I’m just ranting at this point. Overall, I had fun creating this website. With the knowledge of how things aren’t going to go your way I will plan further into the future. I enjoyed it and felt that the website creation process was worthwhile, even with the obstacles and time limits. It reaffirmed the significance of resilience and adaptation and gave me insightful knowledge about the reality of project development. Even if the outcome might not have been quite what I had hoped for, I'm proud of what I managed to do in the current situation. I'll approach my next endeavors with a deeper understanding of the necessity of flexibility in the face of obstacles and the inevitable nature of failures going ahead. Considering this experience, I understand how crucial it is to prepare ahead and manage your time well, particularly while balancing several obligations. Keeping these skills in mind, I feel more prepared to handle next projects and get beyond any challenges that may arise. </p>
