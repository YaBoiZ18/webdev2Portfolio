                    <h3>What is your opinion on Ai artist?</h3>
        
                    <p>As we talked about the question, he was still neutral on the topic of ai artiest. For example, he thinks that there are some good things that Ai artist brings. Such as, “On one hand, the advancements in AI technology have brought about some truly mind-blowing creations. The ability of AI to analyze vast amounts of data and generate unique pieces of art is pretty remarkable. It opens up new avenues for creativity and pushes the boundaries of what we consider art.” I can see where he’s coming from too. I can see how it opens up to new avenues of creativity, more places of exploration for artists alike. But he also knows the problems with it. “But on the other hand, there's this ongoing debate about the role of human creativity and intuition in art. Some argue that AI-generated art lacks the soul and emotion that human artists infuse into their work. There's this fear that AI might eventually replace human artists altogether, which raises questions about the future of artistic expression and the value we place on human creativity.” Here he talks about the controversies of Ai art. As he said with how some argue that AI-generated art lacks the soul and emotion that human artists infuse into their work, I can agree with this. Whenever I see Ai art I like it, but I don’t feel anything when looking at it. </p>

                    <h3>Are Ai artists actually artist?</h3>
        
                    <p>With this question he had to take a minute to answer. He states that, “If we define an artist as someone who creates art, then technically, AI-generated art would qualify. After all, AI algorithms are creating visual or auditory outputs that can be appreciated for their aesthetic value.” But then he also talks about how if we consider the traditional notion of an artist as someone who infuses their work with personal expression, emotions, and intentionality, then it becomes a bit more complicated. “AI lacks consciousness, emotions, and subjective experiences that human artists bring to their creations.” Which I agree with as AI doesn't have personal stories, struggles, or triumphs that influence its artistic choices. Ultimately, he thinks the label of "artist" for AI-generated art is subjective and open to interpretation. Some people may consider it art, while others may not.</p>

                <section class="q3">
                    <h3>Do you think that human art is still wanted? </h3>
        
                    <p>This answer was more straightforward. “Absolutely, human art is definitely still wanted, appreciated, and valued. While AI-generated art has its place and can offer some fascinating insights and creations, there's something inherently special about art created by humans.” He then talks about how human art carries with it the essence of our experiences, emotions, and perspectives. It reflects our individuality, cultural backgrounds, and personal stories. “So, while AI-generated art may offer new possibilities and challenges our understanding of creativity, human art will always have its place in the world. It's an essential part of our cultural heritage, a means of communication and expression, and a source of inspiration for generations to come.”</p>
