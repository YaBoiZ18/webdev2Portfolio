                <h3>What is your opinion on how Ai can copy someone else’s art style?</h3>
    
                <p>As we talked about this question, I can tell that he was uncomfortable about Ai. As he says, “I just can't shake my discomfort with the whole idea of AI copying someone else's art style. I get that technology moves forward and all, but there's something about it that just feels... I don't know, kind of wrong to me.” He then goes on about how art is supposed to be a reflection of someone's unique perspective, it’s about expressing yourself in a way that's totally your own. So, when you have AI coming in and essentially mimicking that, it feels like it's taking away from the authenticity of the whole thing. Plus, there's the whole issue of ownership and originality. If an AI can perfectly replicate someone else's style, where does that leave the actual artist? It's like their work becomes devalued because it can be easily replicated by a machine.</p>

                <h3>How do you feel about Ai artist claiming they are artist?</h3>
    
                <p>While discussing about this question, he had a disappointed tone. “Honestly, it's a bit frustrating to me. I mean, sure, AI can create some pretty impressive stuff, there's no denying that. But claiming to be an artist? That feels like a stretch.” He then talks about how art is so much more than just producing images or music or whatever else. It's about the human experience, about emotion and creativity and all those intangible things that make us who we are. And he just doesn’t see how a machine can truly grasp that.</p>

            <section class="q3">
                <h3>Do you think that human art is still wanted? </h3>
    
                <p>This answer was very straightforward and short. “Absolutely, without a doubt. I think human art will always be wanted and valued. There's something special about knowing that a piece of art was created by another human being, with all their unique perspectives, emotions, and experiences woven into it.” Which I agree with as people connect with art on a deeply personal level, and part of that connection comes from knowing that there's a human behind the work, someone who has poured their soul into what they've created. That's something that AI just can't replicate.</p>
